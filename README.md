### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordan Poles, I'm an Internal Medicine Physician, Healthcare Researcher, Full-Stack Web Developer, Data Analysis and Visualization Enthusiast, and DIYer (among the many hats I wear).

My Github is where I share my many projects, collaborate with others, build, and innovate. 

You can read more about some of my projects on my [blog](https://blog.jpoles1.com/)

Or check out some of my design work for 3D printing at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@jpoles1_301817/models)
